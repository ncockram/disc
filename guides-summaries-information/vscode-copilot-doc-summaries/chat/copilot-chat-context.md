# VS Code Copilot Chat Context Management

**Source:** [VS Code Copilot Chat Context](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context)

## Introduction

Context is crucial for getting relevant and accurate responses from GitHub Copilot Chat. This guide covers all the ways to provide context to Copilot, from simple file references to advanced workspace indexing techniques.

## Why Context Matters

Context helps Copilot understand:
- **Your codebase structure** and architecture
- **Current working files** and their relationships  
- **Specific problems** you're trying to solve
- **Project conventions** and coding standards
- **Dependencies and frameworks** in use

Without proper context, Copilot may provide generic solutions that don't fit your specific situation.

## Context Types Overview

### Automatic Context
VS Code automatically includes:
- **Currently open files** - Files visible in editor tabs
- **Active selection** - Text selected in the editor
- **Cursor position** - Location context within files
- **Recent edits** - Recently modified code areas
- **Error context** - Problems and diagnostics in view

### Manual Context Addition
You can explicitly add:
- **Specific files** - Using `#file:` syntax
- **Code symbols** - Classes, functions, variables with `#symbol:`
- **Terminal output** - Command results and logs
- **Custom selections** - Manually chosen code blocks
- **External resources** - URLs, documentation links

## File References with `#` Syntax

### Basic File References

Reference any file in your workspace:

```
#package.json How do I add a new dependency?
```

```
#src/components/Header.jsx Explain how this component works
```

```
#README.md Update the installation instructions based on recent changes
```

### Multiple File References

Include multiple files for comprehensive context:

```
#server.js #routes/api.js #models/User.js How do these files work together for user authentication?
```

### File Patterns and Folders

Reference entire directories or file patterns:

```
#src/components/ Review all React components for accessibility issues
```

```
#*.test.js Analyze the test coverage and suggest improvements
```

### Specific File Sections

Reference particular parts of files:

```
#src/app.js:15-30 Explain this middleware configuration
```

```
#config/database.js:connectionString Why might this connection fail?
```

## Symbol References

### Class and Function References

Reference specific code symbols:

```
#UserService What methods are available in this class?
```

```
#calculateTotal How can I optimize this function?
```

```
#validateEmail Is this validation function secure?
```

### Variable and Constant References

Include specific variables in context:

```
#API_ENDPOINTS How are these endpoints used throughout the application?
```

```
#userState Explain how this state is managed
```

### Type and Interface References (TypeScript)

Reference type definitions:

```
#UserInterface What properties are required for this interface?
```

```
#APIResponse How should I handle this response type?
```

## Advanced Context Variables

### Selection Context

The `#selection` variable includes your current editor selection:

```
#selection Refactor this code to use modern ES6 syntax
```

**Usage tips:**
- Select relevant code before asking questions
- Use for focused refactoring requests
- Combine with file context for broader understanding

### Terminal Context

Access terminal command output:

```
#terminalLastCommand Why did this command fail?
```

```
#terminalSelection Explain what this output means
```

**Common use cases:**
- Debugging command-line errors
- Understanding build output
- Analyzing test results

### Codebase Context

For project-wide questions:

```
#codebase What is the overall architecture of this application?
```

```
#codebase How is error handling implemented across the project?
```

**Performance note:** Codebase context can be expensive for large projects. Use sparingly and be specific about what you need.

## Using Chat Participants for Context

### @workspace Participant

The `@workspace` participant automatically includes relevant project context:

```
@workspace How do I add a new feature to this application?
```

```
@workspace What testing strategy is used in this project?
```

```
@workspace Are there any security vulnerabilities I should address?
```

**Advantages:**
- Automatically selects relevant files
- Understands project structure
- Considers dependencies and configuration

### @vscode Participant

For VS Code-specific context:

```
@vscode How do I configure debugging for this project?
```

```
@vscode What extensions would help with this codebase?
```

### @terminal Participant

For command-line context:

```
@terminal How do I deploy this application?
```

```
@terminal What npm scripts are available in this project?
```

## Context Addition UI

### Attach Context Button

Use the **Attach Context** button in the Chat view:

1. Click the **paperclip icon** in the chat input
2. Choose context type from the menu:
   - **Files** - Select specific files from your workspace
   - **Selection** - Include current editor selection
   - **Symbols** - Choose classes, functions, or variables
   - **Terminal** - Include terminal output

### Context Menu Integration

Right-click context menus provide quick access:

- **In Explorer** - "Add to Chat Context" on files/folders
- **In Editor** - "Explain with Copilot" on selected code
- **In Terminal** - "Ask Copilot about output" on command results

### Quick Pick Context

Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "Copilot":
- **"Copilot: Add Selection to Context"**
- **"Copilot: Add File to Context"**
- **"Copilot: Add Symbol to Context"**

## Best Practices for Context Management

### Start Small, Add As Needed

Begin with minimal context and add more if needed:

```
// Start simple
How do I handle form validation?

// Add context if response is too generic
#components/LoginForm.jsx How do I improve form validation in this component?

// Add more context for comprehensive help
#components/LoginForm.jsx #utils/validation.js #types/User.ts How can I improve the validation system across these files?
```

### Be Specific About Intent

Combine context with clear intent:

```
#api/auth.js /fix The login endpoint returns 500 errors
```

```
#components/Dashboard.jsx /refactor Improve performance and readability
```

```
#package.json /explain What do these dependencies do?
```

### Layer Context Appropriately

Choose the right level of context:

- **Function-level**: For specific implementation questions
- **File-level**: For component or module questions  
- **Multi-file**: For feature or integration questions
- **Project-level**: For architecture or strategy questions

### Context Size Considerations

**Optimal context size:**
- Include 2-5 relevant files for most questions
- Avoid including large files unless necessary
- Use specific file sections when possible
- Consider token limits for complex contexts

**Signs of too much context:**
- Slow response times
- Generic or unfocused answers
- "Context too large" errors
- Irrelevant suggestions

## Advanced Techniques

### Contextual Follow-ups

Build on previous context in conversations:

```
// Initial question with context
#src/api/ How is authentication implemented?

// Follow-up leverages existing context
How can I add OAuth to this existing system?

// Additional context for specific implementation
#config/oauth.js Show me how to configure Google OAuth
```

### Context Inheritance

Some context carries forward in conversations:
- **Referenced files** remain in context for follow-ups
- **Chat participants** continue providing domain context
- **Current selections** update automatically

### Dynamic Context Updates

Context updates as you work:
- **File changes** reflect in ongoing conversations
- **New selections** override previous selection context
- **Terminal commands** update `#terminalLastCommand`

## Workspace Indexing

### How Indexing Works

VS Code indexes your workspace to provide better context:

- **Symbol extraction** - Classes, functions, variables
- **Dependency mapping** - Import/export relationships
- **File relationships** - Which files work together
- **Usage patterns** - How symbols are used across the project

### Optimizing Index Performance

**For better indexing:**
- Keep projects focused and well-organized
- Use clear file and folder naming
- Maintain clean import/export structures
- Remove unused files and dependencies

**Index status indicators:**
- Check status bar for indexing progress
- Use Command Palette: "Developer: Show Copilot Index Status"
- Monitor performance with large projects

### Index Troubleshooting

**Common indexing issues:**
- **Incomplete context** - Wait for indexing to complete
- **Outdated suggestions** - Reload window to refresh index
- **Missing symbols** - Check file syntax and compilation errors
- **Performance problems** - Consider excluding large files/folders

## Context Security and Privacy

### Sensitive Information

Be cautious with context containing:
- **API keys and credentials** - Use environment variables
- **Personal data** - Avoid including in chat context
- **Proprietary algorithms** - Consider intellectual property implications
- **Internal URLs and endpoints** - May expose infrastructure details

### Context Filtering

VS Code provides controls for context sensitivity:
- **File exclusion patterns** - Configure in settings
- **Workspace-level controls** - Organization policies
- **Extension settings** - Customize context behavior

### Data Handling

Understanding how context is processed:
- **Temporary processing** - Context is not permanently stored
- **Privacy controls** - Respect GitHub Copilot privacy settings
- **Enterprise features** - Additional controls for organizations

## Troubleshooting Context Issues

### Common Problems

**Context not being recognized:**
```
// Instead of generic references
How do I fix this function?

// Use specific context
#src/utils/parser.js:25-40 How do I fix this parsing function?
```

**Too much irrelevant context:**
```
// Instead of everything
@workspace #codebase #src/ #tests/ #docs/ How do I add logging?

// Focus on relevant files
#src/logger.js #config/logging.json How do I improve the logging configuration?
```

**Context not updating:**
- Save files before asking questions
- Refresh VS Code if indexing seems stuck
- Check file permissions and accessibility

### Performance Issues

**Large context sets:**
- Break questions into smaller, focused inquiries
- Use specific file sections instead of entire files
- Consider multiple conversations for complex topics

**Slow responses:**
- Reduce context size to essential files only
- Use `#selection` instead of entire files when possible
- Check network connection and Copilot service status
