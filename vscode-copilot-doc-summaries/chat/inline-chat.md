## Editor Inline Chat

### Overview

Editor Inline Chat provides AI assistance directly at your cursor position, making it perfect for:
- **Code explanations** - Understand complex code sections
- **Targeted refactoring** - Improve specific code blocks
- **Quick fixes** - Resolve errors and issues inline
- **Feature additions** - Add functionality to existing code

### Activating Editor Inline Chat

**Primary method:**
- **Keyboard shortcut:** `Ctrl+I`
- **Command Palette:** `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Editor Inline Chat"
- **Context menu:** Right-click → "Copilot: Start Inline Chat"

### Working with Selections

**Select code first for targeted assistance:**

```javascript
// Select this function before using inline chat
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

Then use `Ctrl+I` and ask:
```
Refactor this to handle tax calculation and discounts
Add error handling for invalid items
Optimize for better performance
```

3. **Ask your question** about commands or tasks
4. **Review the suggested command**
5. **Choose action:**
   - **Run** (`Ctrl+Enter`) - Execute immediately
   - **Insert** (`Alt+Enter`) - Add to terminal for editing
   - **Copy** - Copy command to clipboard

### Example Terminal Prompts

```

## Context Integration

### Adding Context to Inline Chat

**File context:**
```
#package.json How do I add a new script to this project?
#src/components/Header.jsx Explain how this component works
```

**Selection context:**
- Select code in editor before using `Ctrl+I`
- Inline chat automatically includes selected text
- Provides targeted assistance for specific code blocks

**Project context:**
```
@workspace How do I set up testing for this project?
@workspace What's the build process for this application?
```

### Cross-Context Workflows

**Editor to terminal:**
1. Use editor inline chat to understand build process
2. Switch to terminal inline chat for build commands
3. Execute commands based on editor understanding

**Terminal to editor:**
1. Use terminal to investigate project structure
2. Switch to editor to implement changes
3. Use insights from terminal exploration

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompt Writing

**Be specific about scope:**
```
// Instead of: "Fix this"
// Use: "Fix the TypeScript type errors in this interface definition"
```

**Provide context:**
```
// Instead of: "How do I deploy?"
// Use: "How do I deploy this React app to Netlify with environment variables?"
```

**Use progressive refinement:**
```
// Start broad
Add form validation

// Get specific
Make the email validation more strict

// Add features
Include password strength indicator
```

### Code Selection Strategy

**Select meaningful blocks:**
- Complete functions or methods
- Logical code sections
- Related variable declarations
- Error-prone areas needing attention

**Avoid selecting:**
- Partial statements or expressions
- Unrelated code mixed together
- Extremely large code blocks
- Code with missing dependencies

### Terminal Efficiency

**Learn command patterns:**
- Start with basic requests
- Build understanding of command structure
- Gradually use more complex operations
- Create reusable command patterns

**Safety considerations:**
- Review commands before execution
- Understand destructive operations
- Test commands in safe environments
- Use version control for important changes

    if (data[i].status === 'active') {
      result.push(data[i]);
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// Select function, use Ctrl+I, prompt: "Optimize this function"
