## Overview

Jared Kaplan, a theoretical physicist turned AI researcher at Anthropic, presents a comprehensive overview of scaling laws in AI and their implications for reaching human-level artificial intelligence. The talk combines technical insights with practical advice for builders and entrepreneurs.

## Background: From Physics to AI

### Jared's Journey
- **Physics Background**: Theoretical physicist for most of career, working in academia
- **Motivation**: Originally interested in physics due to science fiction (faster-than-light travel) and fundamental questions about the universe
- **Transition to AI**: ~6 years ago, initially skeptical about AI progress
- **Key Insight**: Applied physicist's approach of asking "dumb questions" to AI scaling

### Why Physics Perspective Matters
- **Big Picture Thinking**: Focus on macro trends and making them precise
- **Empirical Approach**: Looking for patterns across many orders of magnitude
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends as precise as those in physics/astronomy

## The Two Phases of AI Training

### 1. Pre-Training Phase
- **Purpose**: Train models to imitate human-written data
- **Mechanism**: Learning correlations in large corpora of text (and multimodal data)
- **Core Task**: Predicting the next word/token in sequences
- **Result**: Models learn what words are likely to follow others

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Phase
- **Purpose**: Optimize models for useful, safe behavior
- **Method**: Human feedback on model outputs (choosing better responses)
- **Goal**: Reinforce helpful, honest, harmless behaviors
- **Interface**: Early Claude training used comparison interfaces for human raters

## Scaling Laws: The Fundamental Discovery

### Key Findings
- **Precision**: Scaling laws are as precise as physics/astronomy laws
- **Scope**: Hold across many orders of magnitude in:
  - Compute power
  - Dataset size
  - Neural network size
- **Predictability**: Enable forecasting of AI capabilities improvement
- **Universality**: Apply to both pre-training and reinforcement learning phases

### Historical Context
- **Discovery Timeline**: Initial work 5-6 years ago (2019)
- **Methodology**: Asked simple questions about "big data" importance
- **Surprise Factor**: Unexpectedly precise mathematical relationships

### Reinforcement Learning Scaling
- **Research**: Andy Jones studied scaling laws for game-playing (Hex)
- **Method**: Single GPU experiments on simpler games than AlphaGo
- **Results**: Clear scaling trends in ELO scores vs. compute
- **Implication**: Systematic improvement possible in RL phase

## AI Capability Framework

### Two-Axis Model
1. **Y-Axis (Flexibility)**: Ability to handle different modalities and domains
   - AlphaGo: High intelligence, low flexibility (Go-specific)
   - LLMs: Increasing flexibility across modalities
   - Future: All human-accessible modalities (potentially including smell)

2. **X-Axis (Time Horizon)**: Length of tasks AI can complete
   - **Current**: Hours-long tasks
   - **Trend**: Doubling every ~7 months (empirical finding)
   - **Future**: Days, weeks, months, years, decades

### Capability Progression
- **Present**: Minute/hour-scale tasks
- **Near-term**: Multi-day complex projects
- **Long-term**: Organizational-scale work
- **Ultimate**: Scientific community-level research (50 years of physics progress in days/weeks)

## Claude 4: Current Capabilities

### Key Improvements Over Claude 3.5
- **Better Agency**: More thoughtful task execution, less "eager" behavior
- **Improved Oversight**: Better following of directions, higher code quality
