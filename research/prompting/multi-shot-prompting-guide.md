# Multi-Shot Prompting Guide

## What is Multi-Shot?

**Multi-shot prompting** is a technique in prompt engineering where you provide multiple examples in your prompt to help AI models understand the desired pattern, format, or task approach. By showing several input-output pairs, you establish a clear template for the model to follow.

## Shot-Based Terminologies

### Core Types
- **Zero-shot**: No examples provided - relies solely on instructions
- **One-shot**: Single example to demonstrate the task
- **Few-shot**: Small number of examples (typically 2-10)
- **Multi-shot**: Multiple examples (often synonymous with few-shot)

### Example Structure
```
Task: [Description]

Example 1:
Input: [Sample input]
Output: [Expected output]

Example 2:
Input: [Sample input]
Output: [Expected output]

[Additional examples...]

Now perform the task: [New input]
```

## Related Prompting Techniques

### Advanced Methods
- **Chain-of-thought (CoT)**: Adding reasoning steps to examples
- **Template-based prompting**: Using consistent formats across examples
- **Instruction following**: Combining clear instructions with examples
- **Role-based prompting**: Defining AI persona alongside examples

### Learning Paradigms
- **In-context learning**: Model learning from prompt examples without parameter updates
- **Meta-learning**: Learning to learn from few examples
- **Transfer learning**: Applying knowledge from training to new tasks

## Key Concepts

### Technical Considerations
- **Context window**: Maximum text length the model can process
- **Token limits**: Constraints on prompt and response length
- **Example selection**: Choosing representative and diverse examples
- **Order effects**: How example sequence impacts performance

### Optimization Strategies
- **Prompt tuning**: Systematically improving prompt effectiveness
- **Example curation**: Selecting high-quality, relevant examples
- **Format consistency**: Maintaining uniform structure across examples
- **Error analysis**: Identifying and addressing failure patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Use diverse examples** that cover different scenarios
2. **Maintain consistent formatting** across all examples
3. **Include edge cases** when relevant
4. **Keep examples concise** but comprehensive
5. **Test with different example orders** to ensure robustness

## Applications

- **Text classification** (sentiment, topic, intent)
- **Data extraction** and transformation
- **Creative writing** with style guidelines
- **Code generation** with specific patterns
- **Translation** with domain-specific
