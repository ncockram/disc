## Overview

Agentic Design Patterns represent a transformative approach to building intelligent AI systems where autonomous agents collaborate with tools, environments, and each other. Rather than isolated AI capabilities, these patterns create orchestrated systems that think, plan, and act cohesively to solve complex real-world problems.

## Key Concepts

**Definition:** Architectural and behavioral templates that guide the development of AI systems where agents (autonomous or semi-autonomous entities) work together in well-coordinated teams, equipped with tools and processes to tackle complex problems.

**Core Value Proposition:** These patterns bridge the gap between isolated AI capabilities and fully integrated systems, enabling scalability, modularity, and adaptability in AI architecture.

## Why Agentic Design Patterns Matter

1. **Streamlined Architecture** - Simplify complexity through reusable templates
2. **Efficient Collaboration** - Enable agents to share context and divide tasks effectively
3. **Scalability** - Modular workflows that grow seamlessly with demands
4. **Adaptability** - Flexible evolution without system overhauls

## The Four Core Agentic Design Patterns

### 1. Reflection Pattern
- **Purpose:** Self-evaluation and iterative improvement
- **Key Features:** Agents assess their performance and adjust strategies based on outcomes
- **Example:** Trading bot analyzing daily portfolio performance to refine strategies
- **Flow:** Action  Outcome Collection  Reflection  Refinement

### 2. Tool Use Pattern
- **Purpose:** Extending agent capabilities through external tools/APIs
- **Key Features:** Specialized functionality and seamless tool integration
- **Example:** Customer support bot using billing API to retrieve account information
- **Flow:** Task Identification  Tool Invocation  Data Retrieval  Integration

### 3. Planning Pattern
- **Purpose:** Multi-step plan formulation and execution for complex objectives
- **Key Features:** Dynamic goal alignment and sequential execution with dependency management
