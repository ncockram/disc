**Content:** A comprehensive playbook for building domain-native LLM applications with focus on healthcare use cases

## Overview

Christopher Lovejoy presents a systematic approach to building domain-native LLM applications, emphasizing that the **system for incorporating domain insights is more important than model sophistication**. Drawing from his experience as a medical doctor turned AI engineer, and his current work at Anterior (a healthcare AI company), he outlines a practical framework for achieving production-level performance in specialized industries.

## Key Insights

### The Last Mile Problem

The primary challenge in specialized industries isn't model power, but giving models the **context and understanding of specific workflows** for particular customers and industries. Traditional approaches plateau around 95% accuracy, but domain-specific systems can push this to 99%+.

**Example:** In medical necessity reviews, a seemingly simple question like "Is there documentation of unsuccessful conservative therapy for at least six weeks?" contains multiple layers of complexity:
- What constitutes "conservative therapy"?
- How do we define "unsuccessful" - partial vs. complete resolution?
- What level of documentation is sufficient for inference?

### The Adaptive Domain Intelligence Engine

This is the core framework with two main components:

#### 1. Measurement Side
- **Define User-Centric Metrics:** Focus on 1-2 metrics that truly matter to customers
  - Healthcare: Minimize false approvals
  - Legal: Minimize missed critical contract terms
  - Fraud Detection: Prevent dollar loss from fraud
  - Education: Optimize test score improvements

- **Failure Mode Ontology:** Systematically categorize how AI fails
  - Medical record extraction failures
  - Clinical reasoning failures
  - Rules interpretation failures
  - Create detailed subcategories within each

#### 2. Improvement Side
- **Production Data Sets:** Use real production failures as training data
- **Iterative Engineering:** Engineers work against specific failure modes with clear performance thresholds
- **Domain Expert Integration:** Enable non-technical domain experts to suggest improvements directly

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Production Application** → Generates AI outputs and decisions
2. **Domain Expert Reviews** → Provide performance insights, failure modes, and improvement suggestions
3. **Domain Expert PM** → Sits at the center, prioritizes based on metrics and failure modes
4. **Engineering Team** → Implements improvements with tight feedback loops
5. **Evaluation Framework** → Tests improvements against specific failure mode datasets

### The Review Dashboard

A custom-built tool that enables domain experts to:
- Review AI outputs alongside source data (medical records, guidelines)
- Mark correct/incorrect decisions
- Categorize failure modes using the established ontology
- Suggest domain knowledge additions
- All in one integrated interface

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Establish Measurement Infrastructure
1. Define top 1-2 metrics that matter most to customers
2. Create failure mode ontology with domain expert input
3. Build review dashboard for systematic evaluation
4. Generate production-based datasets for each failure mode

### Step 2: Create Improvement Loop
1. PM prioritizes failure modes based on impact on key metrics
2. Engineers receive specific datasets and performance targets
3. Rapid iteration against failure mode datasets
4. Domain experts can suggest knowledge additions in real-time
5. Automated evaluation determines when improvements go live

### Step 3: Scale and Automate
- Enable same-day fixes for newly identified issues
- Create self-improving system managed by domain expert PM
- Integrate customer domain experts into the review process
- Build customer-facing validation tools

## Key Success Factors

### Domain Expert Integration
- **Level of Expertise:** Match to workflow complexity (doctors for clinical reasoning, nurses for simpler tasks)
- **Tooling:** Build bespoke tools rather than relying on generic solutions
- **Positioning:** Can be internal hires or customer-facing product users

### Technical Implementation
- **Production Data Focus:** Real customer data beats synthetic data
- **Failure Mode Tracking:** Prevent regression while improving target areas
- **Rapid Iteration:** Enable domain experts to suggest improvements directly

### Organizational Structure
- **Domain Expert PM:** Someone with deep industry knowledge managing the process
- **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Close partnership between domain experts, PM, and engineering
- **Customer Integration:** Eventually involve customer domain experts in the validation process

## Results and Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Baseline:** 95% accuracy with traditional approaches
- **With System:** 99% accuracy achieved
- **Recognition:** Won industry awards for performance

### Business Benefits
- **Rapid Iteration:** Same-day fixes for production issues
- **Customer-Specific Optimization:** Tailored performance for each customer's workflow
- **Scalable Excellence:** Self-improving system that gets better over time
- **Market Advantage:** Superior performance through systematic domain integration

## Industry Applications

### Healthcare (Primary Focus)
- Medical necessity reviews
- Clinical decision support
- Healthcare administration automation
- Insurance claim processing

### Other Verticals
- **Legal:** Contract analysis, clause identification
- **Fraud Detection:** Financial crime prevention
- **Education:** Personalized learning optimization
- **Any Domain:** Where deep expertise and nuanced understanding matter

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Getting Domain Expert Buy-in
**Solution:** Start with internal hires, demonstrate value, then expand to customer integration

### Challenge: Building Custom Tooling
**Solution:** Invest in bespoke solutions when the system is core to your value proposition

### Challenge: Maintaining Quality at Scale
**Solution:** Automated evaluation systems with human-in-the-loop validation

### Challenge: Balancing Speed and Accuracy
**Solution:** Clear performance thresholds and systematic prioritization

## Takeaways for Implementation

1. **System Over Sophistication:** Focus on the infrastructure for domain integration rather than just better models
2. **Production-First:** Use real customer data and workflows as the foundation
3. **Expert-Centric Design:** Build tools that empower domain experts to drive improvements
4. **Metrics-Driven Prioritization:** Let customer impact guide engineering effort
5. **Rapid Feedback Loops:** Enable same-day iteration and deployment cycles

## Conclusion

Building successful domain-native LLM applications requires moving beyond the "better model" approach to creating systematic frameworks for incorporating domain expertise. The key is building adaptive systems that can rapidly translate domain insights into performance improvements, with domain experts at the center of the process. This approach has proven capable of pushing performance from the typical 95% plateau to 99%+ accuracy in production environments.

The framework is particularly powerful because it creates a self-reinforcing cycle: better domain integration leads to better performance, which generates more customer trust and data, which enables even better domain integration. Companies that master this system-level approach will likely dominate their respective vertical markets.
