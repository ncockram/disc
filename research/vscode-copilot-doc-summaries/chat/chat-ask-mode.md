## Getting Started with Ask Mode

### Opening Ask Mode

Ask mode is the default in most chat interfaces:

1. **Chat View** (`Ctrl+Alt+I`) - Ask mode is the default selection
2. **Quick Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) - Opens directly in Ask mode
3. **Inline Chat** (`Ctrl+I`) - Context-aware, often Ask mode for questions
4. **Mode Selector** - Explicitly choose "Ask" from the dropdown

### Basic Question Patterns

**Learning about code:**
```
What does this function do?
How does this algorithm work?

// Instead of: "How does React work?"
// Ask: "How does React's virtual DOM improve performance compared to direct DOM manipulation?"
```

**Provide context for better answers:**
```
// Instead of: "What's the best database?"
// Ask: "#package.json Given this Node.js application, what database would work best for user authentication and session management?"
```

**Ask for examples and alternatives:**
```
// Request practical examples
Can you show me three different ways to handle form validation in React?

// Ask for trade-offs
What are the trade-offs between different CSS-in-JS solutions?
```

### Building Knowledge Progressively

**Start with fundamentals:**
```
1. What is functional programming?
2. How do pure functions work in JavaScript?
3. How can I apply functional programming principles to React components?
4. #components/ How can I refactor these components to be more functional?
```

**Layer understanding:**
```
1. What is TypeScript and why would I use it?
2. How do I add TypeScript to an existing React project?
3. What are the most important TypeScript features for React development?
4. #src/ How can I gradually add TypeScript to this JavaScript codebase?
```

### Following Up Effectively

**Ask clarifying questions:**
```
// After getting an explanation
Can you explain that middleware example in more detail?

// For alternative approaches
Are there other ways to achieve the same result?

// For practical application
How would this apply to my specific use case?
```

**Connect to your code:**
```
// After learning a concept
#my-component.js How can I apply this pattern to improve this component?

// After understanding a problem
#buggy-function.js Based on what we discussed, what's wrong with this implementation?
```

## Common Ask Mode Patterns

## Integration with Other Modes

### Ask → Edit Workflow

Common pattern for learning then implementing:

// 2. Switch to Edit mode 
Add client-side validation to this form component with proper error handling

// 3. Return to Ask mode for optimization
What are performance considerations for real-time validation?
```

### Ask → Agent Workflow

For complex implementations requiring understanding:

```

What's involved in implementing OAuth authentication?

// 2. Switch to Agent mode for implementation
