# Requirements Document: Your Brain on AI

## Project Overview
**Your Brain on AI** is a research project documenting transformational narratives of 25 beings who experienced dramatic power shifts from weakness to strength.

## Objectives
- Document 25 case studies following the "Before: weak → After: strong" transformation pattern
- Create a comprehensive markdown report analyzing dramatic transformations across various domains
- Provide insights into the nature of significant power shifts and capability enhancement

## Examples

- Clark Kent → Superman

## Deliverables
- Single markdown report containing 25 documented cases
- Each case study must include:
  - Clear "Before" state (weakness/limitation)
  - Clear "After" state (strength/enhancement) 
  - Brief narrative of the transformation process

## Success Criteria
- All 25 cases documented with consistent formatting
- Clear demonstration of weakness-to-strength progression
- Report delivered in markdown format
- Professional presentation suitable for research publication

## Resources Required
- Research access to transformation case studies across various domains (fictional, historical, mythological)
- Documentation tools and markdown editing capabilities
- Quality assurance review process
