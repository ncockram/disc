<goal>
Provide a comprehensive analysis of the current AI PC build market and provide recommendations for a build suitable for the following uses:
* **Running** large language models locally and some drawing models like Stable Diffusion
* **Training** but this will not be a large use case, very minimal, do not optimize for this but consider it
* **Form Factor** desktop will likely be cheapest but report if it is not, optimize for desktop currently
</goal>

* Read and gather information from the top 10 search results from the google search link
* Produce summaries files of each link, and record the link at the top of each file
* Summary filenames should be saved in the following format: _summary-1.md, _summary-2.md, etc
* Use the 10 summary files to produce the comprehensive analysis output
