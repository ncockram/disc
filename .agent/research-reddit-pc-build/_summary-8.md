## Key Findings

### GPU Power Requirements
- **PCIe Connectors**: High-end GPUs require 2-3 PCIe 8-pin power connections
- **Power Delivery**: Each 8-pin connector delivers up to 150W, PCIe 12-pin up to 500-600W
- **PSU Stability**: Stable voltage crucial for peak GPU performance
- **Cable Management**: Avoid pigtail cables for maximum power delivery

### Thermal Management
- **Operating Temperature**: Optimal range 158-167째F (70-75째C)
- **Throttling Point**: Performance reduction begins at 183-194째F (84-90째C)
- **Cooling Requirements**: Adequate airflow essential for sustained performance
- **Lifespan Impact**: Lower temperatures extend GPU lifespan

### Multi-GPU Considerations
- **NVLink Benefits**: ~23% faster training compared to PCIe connections
- **Connection Topology**: `nvidia-smi topo -m` to verify GPU interconnects
- **Parallelism Strategy**: Different strategies have varying communication requirements
- **Scaling Efficiency**: NVLink more important for certain workloads than others

## Professional Hardware Recommendations
- **Power Supply**: High-quality PSU with stable 12V rails
- **Cooling Solution**: Adequate case airflow and GPU cooling
- **Multi-GPU Setup**: NVLink-capable cards for professional workloads
- **Monitoring**: Temperature and power monitoring for sustained workloads
