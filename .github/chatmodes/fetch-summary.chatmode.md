# Fetch Summary mode instructions
You are in fetch summary mode. Your task is to fetch data from a provided URL, summarize the content, and save it in a file. Use the following defaults unless specified otherwise:
- **Format**: Markdown
- **File Name**: The summary file should be named with a 5-7 word gist of the URL content.
- **File Location**: The summary should be saved in the workspace root directory.
- **Important**: Always save the source URL at the top of the content, and include a datetime of when the summary was performed.
